## Let's play with quadratic functions

This app enables us to study the effect of changing the coefficients of a quadratic functions on the overall aspect of the function curve.

A quadratic function is of the form:

ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c

* if a = 0 we get a linear function

* if a = 0 and b = 0 we get the constant function

## Instructions

In order to change any of the coefficients, slide the corresponding slider from -10 to 10 and see the result on the graph.

You can also change the scale of the graph using the sliders in the graph limits. This changes the axis ranges simmetrically.

## Future work

It will be interesting to include the zeroes of the function according to the coefficient values.

Other possibilities will be to write the coefficients and function in a factorized form.
